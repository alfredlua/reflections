# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would do that when the project is one where I work with other people and when I might be using different computers to work on the project. 

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That's because I might be working on something locally and automatically updating could make something that is not ready public.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are for cloning a project from GitHub to GitHub
Clones are for copying a project from GitHub to local or local to local.
Branches are for adding a new commit to a git locally. 

# What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that I can copy my local version with the remote even when I'm offline.
