# How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A diff shows me what has been added and removed from the old version of the file so that I can easily compare what has changed.

# How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can see what has changed and what might have caused any bugs. 
It also allows me to easily revert to old versions when the new version has caused an issue. 

# What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manually choosing when to create a commit allows me to create a commit at logical checkpoints but could lead to user error (e.g. I forget to save). On the other hand, having versions automatically saved prevents user error but might create a commit when the code isn't working.

# Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In some systems, files are inter-related as in changes in one file can affect other files. In such systems, we would want to save multiple files in one commit to get a clear view of what has been changed. When files are not inter-related, it usually doesn't matter if the files are saved separately. 

# How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log allows me to see all the commits that have been made, including the message of the commit.
git diff shows me the differences between two commits so I know what has been removed and/or added.

# How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

If something really breaks when I make a change, I can easily revert to a previous commit and try to find the change that caused the break.

# Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
